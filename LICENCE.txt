This document is the licence to use the astrophysics simulation code
"PhotoIonization Of Nebulae (PION).  Usage of this software implies acceptance
of the licence!  You do not have to explicity write to me to accept the
licence.

-----------------

This document last updated: 2016.01.24.

The principal author of this code is Jonathan Mackey.

Minor code contributions and major planning/conceptual contributions
have been made by Dr. Andrew J. Lim from 2006-2010.

Metal-free Chemistry/heating/cooling routines contributed by Harpreet Dhanoa.

-----------------

The definitive version of PION is maintained by Jonathan Mackey at
http://bitbucket.org in a version control repository.

-----------------

PION is free software in that you will not be charged money to use it, but
there are some restrictions as to what you are permitted to do with it.

-------------------
Disclaimer:
-------------------

This applies to the code PION, and any code derived from any part of PION.
[change this to BSD licence, b/c the GPL can't be modified].

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

-----------------

In publications which use the code, you agree to cite papers describing the code.  At the moment this is:

 - Mackey & Lim (2010,MNRAS,403,714) for hydrodynamics and raytracing plus photoionisation,
 - Mackey & Lim (2011,MNRAS,412,2079) for photoionisation with magnetohydrodynamics,
 - Mackey (2012,A&A,539,A147) for updated explicit photoionisation algrithm.
 - Dhanoa, Mackey & Yates (2014,MNRAS,444,2085) for metal-free chemistry.

You should cite at least one of these articles, whichever is most
appropriate for the modules you are using.

-----------------

This code, and any codes derived from it or using any of its source code, may
not under any circumstances be used for weapons research and/or military
research, including but not limited to modelling of weapons explosions and the
evolution of associated blast waves, without explicit written permission from
the authors, including handwritten signature.

-----------------

If you modify PION, you must clearly state this in publications arising from
simulations using a modified version of the code.  Furthermore, you must state
clearly what modifications you have made, providing enough information for
another computational astrophysicist to reproduce your results without too much
effort.
