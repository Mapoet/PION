This is the PION licence, which you must agree with in order to use
the code.
Copyright (c) 2006-2013 by Jonathan Mackey

This document, while not particularly well-written, is the licence to
use this code.  If you don't agree with any of the clauses, feel free
to ask me to change them (jmackey@astro.uni-bonn.de) if they are
unreasonable.  Otherwise, usage of this code implies acceptance of the
licence!  You do not have to explicity write to me to accept the
licence.

This licence will probably change significantly over time.  Whenever
it changes significantly, and in particular if the terms of use ever
become more restrictive, a #error command will be put in global.h (or
a descendent of that file) stating that the licence has changed for
the worse and you need to read it!  Failing that all known users will
be informed by email.

-----------------

This document last updated: 2013.01.07.

The principal author of this code is Jonathan Mackey.

Minor code contributions and major planning/conceptual contributions
have been made by Dr. Andrew J. Lim from 2006-2010.

The author of this licence is Jonathan Mackey.
He can be contacted at jmackey@astro.uni-bonn.de

-----------------

The definitive version of this code is maintained by Jonathan Mackey
at the University of Bonn in a version control repository.  This is
likely to remain the case for some time, although a
password-protected publicly accessible (read-only) repository will
hopefully be made available soon.

-----------------

This code *IS* free software in that I'm not going to charge people
money to use it, and nobody is permitted to resell the code, or to use
parts of the code in other projects which will then be sold for
profit.  No part of this code can be used in a piece of software which
is sold at a price (not necessarily generating profit) without prior
agreement of a clear majority of the principal author(s).

-----------------

People who contribute significantly to development of the code can
expect to become a 'contributing author' and also a 'principal author'
assuming the changes are propagated back to the main code source
repository.  This is admittedly a rather fuzzy definition, but the
idea is that contributing users of the code will become co-owners of
the code with some say in its future development and the right to pass
it on to other users.  In particular all contributers are
automatically the principal authors and owners of the components they
have written, and can use and distribute these components under terms
different to this licence.

-----------------

Lots of work has gone into developing this code, and in some sense the
author(s)'s career(s) depend(s) on the aspects of this code which make
its algorithms competitive with and/or superior to other astronomical
codes.  Additionally if an "uninformed" user tries to use the code,
they may attempt to model a system with a sub-optimal solver or
incorrect parameters (which may be undocumented!), and this could give
the code an undeserved bad reputation.  With that in mind, the code is
*NOT* free software in the following senses:

(0) This code is not "public" for anybody to read and use.

(1) You are not free to pass this code on to anybody else without
discussing and agreeing this with the principal author(s) of the code.

(2) Any potential users of the code must agree to point (1) above.

(3) You are expected to contribute any useful changes you make back to
a central code repository maintained by the main author(s)
(i.e. Jonathan Mackey at the moment).

(4) In publications which use the code, you are (at a minimum)
expected to cite papers describing the code.  At the moment this is

 - Mackey & Lim (2010,MNRAS,403,714) for hydrodynamics and raytracing plus photoionisation,
 - Mackey & Lim (2011,MNRAS,412,2079) for photoionisation with magnetohydrodynamics,
 - Mackey (2012,A&A,539,A147) for updated explicit photoionisation algrithm.

You should cite at least one of these articles, whichever is most
appropriate for the modules you are using.

(5) This code, and any codes derived from it or using any of its
source code, may not under any circumstances be used for weapons
research and/or military research, including but not limited to
modelling of weapons explosions and the evolution of associated blast
waves, without explicit written permission from Jonathan Mackey (on
paper, with an original signature).

(6) Changes made to the code must be noted at the top of the file
using the existing convention, including the date and your initials.
When writing a new piece of code this only applies once it is working
(i.e. every hour's work does not have to be documented -- once it is
working just write e.g. "2010.10.13 JM: wrote licence for code").

(7) You must work in collaboration with at least one of the principal
authors of the code, at least for your first project which uses the
code, if for no other reason than to learn how it works and what its
limitations are.

(8) If you modify the code, you must clearly state this in
publications arising from simulations using a modified version of the
code.  Furthermore, you must state clearly what modifications you
have made, providing enough information for another computational 
astrophysicist to reproduce your results without too much effort.

(9) Redistributions of source code must reproduce this copyright
notice, this list of conditions and disclaimers, unchanged and in its
entirety (i.e. all of the text in this licence file).

(10) Redistributions in binary form must reproduce this copyright
notice, this list of conditions and disclaimers, unchanged and in its
entirety (i.e. all of the text in this licence file).

(11) The names of the authors (Jonathan Mackey), the names of the
institutions that fund and/or host its development, and the names of
institutions which have funded and/or hosted its development in the
past, may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this Software without specific prior written permission.

YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

-------------------

Having said all that, all of this code is in some sense "open source"
because its development has been funded by the Irish and German
taxpayers.  What this means is that reasonable requests for access to
the code won't be turned down.
