\paragraph{2013.02.07 (4 hours)}
I added some documentation to UsersGuide.tex.
It needs a lot of work before it will actually be useful.
But maybe I can add a paragraph about each test problem as I update it to work with pion.

Updated the stdout output from pion so that it is neater (at least for serial code, hydro, no microphysics, no raytracing).  I may need to do more work later when I run some MHD tests with RT/MP.

I updated the axisymmetric blast-wave test problem so that it runs on pion.
I still need to modify the scripts so that it produces output that would be useful for a user (e.g.\ Dominique), because at the moment it is set up for making sure the code still works after I make a change.
