This document last updated: 2016/08/25.

The principal author of this code is Jonathan Mackey.

Minor code contributions and major planning/conceptual contributions
have been made by Andrew J. Lim from 2006-2010.

Metal-free Chemistry/heating/cooling routines contributed by Harpreet Dhanoa.

Python analysis tools developed with Sam Green.

-----------------

The definitive version of PION is maintained by Jonathan Mackey at
http://bitbucket.org/jmackey/pion in a version control repository.

-----------------

PION is free software in that you will not be charged money to use it, but
there are some restrictions as to what you are permitted to do with it.  The
following restrictions largely follow the BSD licence, but with a couple of
additions.

4. If you modify PION, you must clearly state this in publications arising from
simulations using a modified version of the code.  Furthermore, you must state
clearly what modifications you have made, providing enough information for
another computational astrophysicist to reproduce your results with reasonable
effort.

5. PION, and any codes derived from it or using any of its source code, may not
under any circumstances be used for weapons research and/or military research,
including but not limited to modelling of weapons explosions and the evolution
of associated blast waves, without explicit written permission from the
authors, including handwritten signature.

6. In publications which use PION, or a modified version of PION, or components
of PION incorporated into a new code, you agree to cite at least one of the
relevant papers describing PION and its components:

   photoionisation,
 - Mackey & Lim (2011,MNRAS,412,2079) for photoionisation with
   magnetohydrodynamics,
 - Mackey (2012,A&A,539,A147) for updated explicit photoionisation algrithm.
